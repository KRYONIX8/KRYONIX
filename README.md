# Process to Build/Compile/Load the code


The process for uploading the code to the robot controllers is based on the use of "Geany" within the Raspberry Pi OS. 

Geany is a text editor and Integrated Development Environment (IDE), used for programming with Pyton on a Raspberry Pi. The first thing to do is open a new file (or an existing one) in the Geany IDE within the Raspberry Pi OS. Once the file is open, the code writing process is started, treating the structure as if it were Python; upon completion, the file is save with the ".py" extension. 

Once the file is saved with the ".py" extension, the file is automatically detected by Geany as a Python script.

Once the file with the ".py" extension is available, the command console of the Raspberry Pi OS must be opened. Inside the console, the following command is run: python3 my_script.py, replacing "my script" with the name of the file. Upon completion of this step, the code will run automatically. :shipit:
